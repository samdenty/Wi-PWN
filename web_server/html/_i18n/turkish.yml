#        TRANSLATION FILE
# 
# Format:
#   What is '$$'?
#       '$$' is a variable thats replaced with HTML
#       For example:
#          `$$click here$$`     =>   `<a href="mypage">click here</a>`
#          `translated by $$`   =>   `translated by sam`
#
#   DO NOT REMOVE THE INDENTATION!
#       The indentation is critical to YAML, so please don't change it
#   
#   Try and retain the case, for example:
#       If it is capitalized keep it capitalized
#   
#   What are the `translation.name` & `translation.url`?
#       These are strings that will be added to the footer & info page
#   
#   I'm unsure about how to translate something / I have a question
#       No problem! feel free to ask something over at
#       https://wi-pwn.samdd.me/discord/
#       
#   What encoding should I use?
#       UTF-8 ~ jekyll doesn't support any other encodings
# 

translation:
    # Uncomment & insert your name here
    #name: "my-name"
    # Uncomment & insert a link to your Github / site
